// javascrpipt execution contest the code in two ways
// {} -> this is global execution context this is the first thing which is formed ( this is also called memory creation phase)
// next there comes execution phase 
// 1. Global Execution context
//2. Function execution context
//3. Eval execution context
// 2.In memory phase first there val is given undefined , even if the no. is given if it is called through function
//3. (this is execution phase) val1 then assgined the given no. 
// the no. of times we call the fucntion same no. of times both 2,3 phases are repeated
// the new variable environment + execution thread formed will be deleted once used 
// there is another thing called call stack , functions once used are put instack then when used are removed
