// promise krta hai promise aur phir batata ki vo cheez aage jake hogi yaa nhi hogi 
// the code we made last we will execute that with the help of promises now
// the promises object represents the eventual completetion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value
//Promise  object has two things (resolve and reject)

// like in last internetspeed function instead of success and failure we will return the promise object
